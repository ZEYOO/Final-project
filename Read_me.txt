This is the final project for camera calibration and augmented reality

1) the details of this project is represented in the PDF file of final project report.

2) The process of camera calibration is in the MATLAB file camera_calibration.m

3) The augmented reality of a simple 3D cubic is in the file cubic_plot.m

4) The augmented reality of a complex 3D teapot is in the file teapot_plot.m

5) File three_D_geometry is the illustration of the simple Cubic and teapot.

6) The Camera matrix is gotten from the camera calibration APP in matlab which is also explained in the project report.
